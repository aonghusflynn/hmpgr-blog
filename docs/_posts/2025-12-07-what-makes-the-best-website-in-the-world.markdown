# What Makes the Best Website in the World?

What makes the best website in the world? This will mean different things to different people. How do you measure what is the best website in the world? 

For me, it's a website that reflects our values and gives our customers what they need when they need it, while helping grow the business.

## Core Values That Define Great Websites

### Trust

Trust is the foundation of any successful website. This means:

- Treating all user data with respect
- Not contacting anyone who doesn't want to be contacted
- Ensuring all web properties are secure

Without trust, everything else falls apart.

### Customer Success

Give customers what they need to be successful. Whether that's information on the correct product to buy, training, where they can get add-ons, good demos, or free trials - the website should enable their success.

### Innovation

Create innovative solutions to serve customer needs. But know the difference between true innovation and flashy, purposeless experiences that don't help the customer. Innovation should solve problems, not create them.

### Equality

The website should be for everyone. Accessibility is how we make this happen. Ensuring our websites meet accessibility standards isn't optional - it's essential.

### Sustainability

Can we lower the energy usage of our data centers by creating energy-efficient websites? Minute changes in the power required to process and serve a webpage, when scaled up, could have massive impact on our environmental footprint.

## Principles for Customer-Centered Websites

### Think Universal

A website is for everyone, on any device, in any country. Design with this universality in mind from the start.

### Keep It Simple

Use easy-to-understand language - the terms people actually search for. Remember: a web page is not a magazine ad. Clarity beats cleverness every time.

### Value Exchange

Gather prospect details in a way that doesn't feel like a rip-off. Have the right offers at the right time. If you're asking for their information, give them something valuable in return.

### Consider the Journey

When creating content, don't think about it in isolation. Consider intent:
- Where did they come from?
- Where will they go next?

Context matters.

## The Bottom Line

The best website in the world isn't about the latest design trends or the fanciest animations. It's about values-driven design that puts users first, ensures accessibility for all, and delivers real value at every touchpoint.

"What does your company do?"

If a visitor can't answer this question within 10 seconds of landing on your homepage, your value proposition isn't clear. And unclear value propositions are conversion killers.

Here's why most B2B homepages fail the clarity test—and how to fix it.

## Problem 1: You're Describing How, Not What

Most value propositions focus on methodology or technology instead of outcomes.

**Unclear (focuses on "how"):**
"AI-powered platform that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data patterns"

**Clear (focuses on "what"):**
"Know which customers will churn next month before they do"

The technology is interesting to you. The outcome is interesting to buyers. Lead with what they get, not how you deliver it.

**The fix:** Rewrite your headline to answer: "What specific outcome do customers get?" Save the "how" for your subheadline or features section.

## Problem 2: You're Using Industry Jargon Without Context

Terms that are obvious to you are meaningless to buyers unfamiliar with your space.

**Unclear examples:**
- "End-to-end workflow optimization"
- "Unified data fabric"
- "Intelligent automation layer"
- "Next-generation orchestration"

What do any of these actually mean? They sound sophisticated but communicate nothing concrete.

**Clear alternatives:**
- "Reduce manual data entry from 4 hours to zero"
- "Connect all your customer data in one place"
- "Auto-generate reports instead of building them manually"
- "Deploy code with one command instead of 50"

**The test:** Can someone outside your industry understand what you do? If not, you're too deep in jargon.

## Problem 3: You're Being Clever Instead of Clear

Clever wordplay might win creative awards, but it confuses buyers and kills conversions.

**Unclear (too clever):**
"Where ambition meets execution"
"Your growth, amplified"
"Empowering tomorrow's innovators"
"Building the future of work"

What do these actually mean? Nothing specific.

**Clear alternatives:**
"Project management for distributed engineering teams"
"Sales coaching that increases close rates by 23%"
"Help developers ship code 10x faster"
"Payroll software for global remote teams"

**The fix:** Replace metaphors and aspirational language with concrete descriptions.

## Problem 4: You're Listing Features, Not Benefits

Features describe what exists. Benefits describe what customers get.

**Feature-focused (unclear value):**
"Real-time analytics dashboard, customizable workflows, and advanced reporting"

**Benefit-focused (clear value):**
"Spot problems before they become incidents, adapt processes as you grow, and prove ROI to leadership"

Features are commodities. Benefits are what people buy.

**Framework:** For every feature, ask "so what?" until you reach the actual business value.
- "Real-time analytics" → "So what?" → "See problems immediately" → "So what?" → "Fix issues before customers notice" → "So what?" → "Protect revenue and reputation"

Lead with that final answer.

## Problem 5: You're Trying to Be Everything to Everyone

Vague positioning that tries to serve every possible customer serves no one well.

**Unclear (too broad):**
"Solutions for businesses of all sizes across every industry"

**Clear (specific):**
"Compliance software for fintech startups navigating their first audit"

Specificity feels exclusive, but it actually attracts the right buyers more effectively. When you say "for everyone," buyers read "for no one specific, therefore probably not optimized for me."

## Problem 6: Your Value Prop Requires Too Much Interpretation

If visitors need to read three paragraphs to understand what you do, they won't.

**Unclear (requires interpretation):**
"We provide a comprehensive ecosystem of integrated solutions that enable organizations to transform their digital infrastructure and achieve operational excellence through strategic alignment of people, processes, and technology."

**Clear (immediately understandable):**
"Help IT teams manage 1,000+ servers with 3 engineers instead of 30."

One is corporate speak that could mean anything. The other is a concrete value proposition you can picture.

## Problem 7: You're Leading with Your Story, Not Their Problem

Buyers don't care about your founding story until they understand if you solve their problem.

**Weak homepage opener:**
"Founded in 2019 by three engineers who met at Stanford, we set out to revolutionize how companies think about..."

**Strong homepage opener:**
"Spending 10 hours per week on manual data entry? Cut it to zero."

Your story matters, but not in the first 10 seconds. Lead with relevance, then earn the right to tell your story.

## Problem 8: You're Using Superlatives Instead of Specifics

Claims like "best-in-class" or "industry-leading" are meaningless without proof.

**Unclear (unsubstantiated):**
"The world's most advanced customer data platform"

**Clear (specific and provable):**
"Process 50M customer events per day with <100ms latency"

Specificity creates credibility. Superlatives create skepticism.

## Examples of Value Props Done Right

Let's look at clear value propositions across different categories:

**Stripe:**
"Financial infrastructure for the internet"
→ Immediately clear what it does and who it's for

**Notion:**
"One workspace. Every team."
→ Specific problem (scattered tools) with specific solution

**Datadog:**
"See inside any stack, any app, at any scale, anywhere"
→ Concrete capability with scope

**Slack:**
"Made for people. Built for productivity."
→ Clear positioning (communication) with clear benefit

Notice how none of these:
- Use clever metaphors
- Lead with features
- Require interpretation
- Try to be everything to everyone

## The Clarity Test

Pull up your homepage and answer these questions:

1. Can a first-time visitor state what you do in one sentence?
2. Can they identify if it's relevant to them?
3. Can they name a specific problem you solve?
4. Can they visualize the outcome they'd get?

If any answer is "no" or "maybe," your value proposition needs work.

## The Rewrite Process

Here's how to clarify your value proposition:

**Step 1: Identify the core problem you solve**
Not the interesting technology. Not your founding insight. The actual painful problem customers have.

**Step 2: State the specific outcome they get**
What changes in their business when they use your product? Be concrete.

**Step 3: Add context about who it's for**
Don't serve everyone. Pick your primary ICP and speak to them.

**Step 4: Remove all jargon and clever language**
Test it on someone outside your company. If they can't paraphrase it back to you, simplify further.

**Step 5: Lead with this everywhere**
Your headline, your sales pitch, your ad copy—all should stem from this clear value prop.

## Why This Matters

An unclear value proposition isn't just a messaging problem—it's a revenue problem. Every confused visitor who bounces is a potential customer you lost. Multiply that across thousands of monthly visitors, and unclear messaging becomes a six-figure mistake.

The good news? Value proposition clarity is entirely within your control. It doesn't require a redesign or new features. Just clear thinking and willingness to be specific.

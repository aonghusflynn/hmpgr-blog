This is a sample blog post demonstrating the new Jekyll theme. The theme features a refined brutalist aesthetic with strong typography and clean layouts.

## Typography & Design

The theme uses **Crimson Pro** for headings and **Work Sans** for body text, creating a distinctive typographic hierarchy. The warm amber accent color (`#FF6B35`) provides visual interest without overwhelming the content.

### Code Blocks

Code is displayed with syntax-friendly styling:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Welcome to your new blog!")
    return True
```

### Lists & Formatting

The theme handles various content types elegantly:

- Clean, readable lists
- Proper spacing and rhythm
- Strong visual hierarchy

> Blockquotes are styled with an accent border and italic text for emphasis.

## Customization

Edit the `_config.yml` file to personalize:
- Site title and description
- Social media links
- Navigation items

The CSS uses variables for easy theming. Adjust colors, fonts, and spacing in `assets/css/style.css`.

## Getting Started

1. Update `_config.yml` with your information
2. Create posts in the `_posts/` directory
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Enjoy your new blog!

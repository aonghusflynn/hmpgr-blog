You don't need consultants or expensive tools to identify critical homepage problems. Most issues are obvious once you know what to look for. Here's a 20-minute audit you can run right now.

## Minute 1-3: The 10-Second Clarity Test

Open your homepage in an incognito window. Set a timer for 10 seconds.

**Can you immediately answer:**
- What does this company do?
- Who is it for?
- What problem does it solve?

If any answer is unclear, you fail the most basic test. Nothing else matters if visitors can't understand what you do in 10 seconds.

**Quick fix:** Rewrite your headline to answer all three questions directly.

## Minute 4-6: Above the Fold Inventory

Without scrolling, what's visible?

**You need:**
- Clear value proposition
- Who it's for (ICP indicator)
- Primary CTA
- One trust signal (logo, metric, certification)

**Red flags:**
- Generic stock photos taking prime real estate
- Multiple competing CTAs
- No clear value proposition
- Company mission statement instead of customer value
- Important information hidden below fold

**Quick fix:** Prioritize ruthlessly. Move customer value above the fold. Push everything else down.

## Minute 7-9: Value Proposition Analysis

Read your headline and subheadline aloud to someone unfamiliar with your company.

**Ask them:**
- Can you explain what we do?
- Would you know if this is relevant to you?
- What outcome would you get?

If they struggle, your messaging needs work.

**Red flags:**
- Clever wordplay that obscures meaning
- Industry jargon without context
- Features instead of outcomes
- Vague benefits ("improve efficiency")
- Could apply to any company in any industry

**Quick fix:** Replace your headline with this formula: "[Specific outcome] for [specific ICP]"

## Minute 10-11: CTA Effectiveness Check

**Count your above-the-fold CTAs.**

Ideal: 1 primary CTA (visually prominent) + 1 optional secondary CTA (visually subordinate)

**Evaluate your primary CTA:**
- Is it obvious where to look?
- Is the action clear? ("Schedule Demo" vs. vague "Learn More")
- Is friction appropriate? (low for early stage, higher for qualified leads)
- Does clicking deliver on the promise?

**Red flags:**
- 3+ CTAs competing for attention
- Vague CTAs ("Get Started," "Learn More")
- High-friction first step (long forms, required sales calls)
- CTA leads somewhere unexpected

**Quick fix:** Pick ONE primary CTA. Make it visually prominent. Make the action specific and low-friction.

## Minute 12-13: Trust Signal Audit

**Scan your homepage for trust signals:**
- Customer logos
- Testimonials
- Case studies
- Metrics ("trusted by 500+ enterprises")
- Security certifications
- Awards or recognition

**Questions:**
- Do you have at least one above the fold?
- Are they specific or generic?
- Are they current or outdated?
- Are they relevant to your ICP?

**Red flags:**
- No trust signals above the fold
- Generic claims without proof
- Outdated testimonials or old dates
- Unknown companies as social proof
- Fake-looking testimonials without attribution

**Quick fix:** Feature your single best trust signal prominently above the fold.

## Minute 14-15: Mobile Experience Check

Pull up your homepage on mobile (or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation).

**Check:**
- Does key information fit without excessive scrolling?
- Is text readable without zooming?
- Are CTAs tappable (not too small)?
- Does the page load quickly?
- Is navigation usable?

**Red flags:**
- Tiny text requiring zoom
- CTAs too small to tap easily
- Horizontal scrolling required
- Important content pushed way down
- Slow load times

**Quick fix:** Test on actual mobile device. Mobile traffic is often 40%+ of B2B traffic.

## Minute 16-17: Speed Test

Run a quick Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools (right-click → Inspect → Lighthouse tab).

**Key metrics:**
- First Contentful Paint (should be <1.8s)
- Time to Interactive (should be <3.8s)
- Overall Performance score (aim for 90+)

**Common culprits:**
- Unoptimized images (huge file sizes)
- Too many scripts loading
- No caching
- Slow server response
- Render-blocking resources

**Quick fix:** Compress and resize images. That alone often solves 80% of performance issues.

## Minute 18-19: Conversion Path Analysis

Click through your primary CTA.

**Ask:**
- Is the next step clear?
- Is friction appropriate?
- Does the experience match the promise?
- Can visitors actually convert?

Example: If your CTA says "Start Free Trial" but leads to "Schedule a call with sales," you've broken trust.

**Red flags:**
- CTA leads somewhere unexpected
- Required information is excessive
- Form has obvious errors
- No confirmation of submission
- Unclear what happens next

**Quick fix:** Match the post-click experience to the CTA promise. Reduce form fields to bare minimum.

## Minute 20: Bounce Rate Reality Check

Open Google Analytics and check:
- Homepage bounce rate
- Average time on page
- Exit rate

**Benchmarks for B2B:**
- Bounce rate: 40-60% is normal, 70%+ is concerning
- Time on page: 60-120 seconds is healthy
- Exit rate: Compare to other pages

**If bounce rate is high:**
- Clarity problem (they don't understand)
- Relevance problem (wrong audience)
- Trust problem (don't believe you)
- Speed problem (page loads too slowly)

Go back through this audit and address the biggest gaps.

## The Prioritized Fix List

You probably found multiple issues. Don't try to fix everything at once.

**Priority 1 (fix this week):**
- Unclear value proposition
- Missing or weak CTA
- Page speed issues
- Mobile usability problems

**Priority 2 (fix this month):**
- Weak trust signals
- Poor information hierarchy
- High-friction conversion path
- Missing objection handling

**Priority 3 (fix this quarter):**
- Content depth
- Segmentation
- Personalization
- Advanced optimization

Start with Priority 1. Fixing critical issues produces the biggest return. For deeper dives on each area, see the related reading below.

## The Ongoing Audit Process

Homepage optimization isn't one-and-done. Run this audit:
- Monthly for active optimization periods
- Quarterly for maintenance
- Immediately after major changes
- When metrics deteriorate

Your homepage should continuously improve based on real user behavior and business results.

## What This Audit Doesn't Cover

This 20-minute audit catches obvious problems. It doesn't cover:
- Detailed user behavior analysis (heatmaps, session recordings)
- A/B testing and statistical validation
- Deep competitive analysis
- Content strategy and SEO
- Advanced conversion optimization

For those, you need more time and expertise.

## Common Patterns in Problem Homepages

Most struggling homepages share these issues:
- Unclear value proposition (by far the most common)
- Weak or missing trust signals
- High-friction CTAs
- Poor mobile experience
- Slow load times
- Generic, vague messaging

Fix these fundamentals before worrying about advanced optimization.

## Your Action Items

After completing this audit:

1. Document the 3 biggest issues you found
2. Estimate impact vs. effort for each
3. Pick one to fix this week
4. Measure the results
5. Iterate

Small improvements compound. You don't need a complete redesign—just systematic identification and fixing of issues.
